Biometric writer recognition is a very active field of research that has produced a considerable body of
 scientific work and papers over the last decades. Signature verification has been one of the most favoured
 approaches while others, such as text-dependent recognition, have attracted very little attention due to a 
perceived lack of practical applicability. This dissertation is circumscribed to the particular field of online
 text-dependent writer recognition, based on short sequences of text, a field where the number of relevant 
reference is really scarce. In this context, online means that not only the static images of the handwriting are 
available but also their dynamic dimension, that is, data is available as a function of time. What is more, thanks
 to modern acquisition devices, other time-dependent information is also available: the pressure exerted while
 writing, the angles of the writing device with respect to the horizontal plane and with respect to the vertical 
axis, and even the trajectories described while not exerting any pressure on the writing surface, when the hand 
moves in the air while transitioning from one stroke to the next (in-air trajectories made up of pen-up strokes).
